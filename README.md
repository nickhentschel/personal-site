# Readme

This is my personal site. It was built using the [SilverStripe](http://silverstripe.org "SilverStripe") framework. All of my code, mostly in /themes/default is available for anyone to use for any purpose.

The site should be available at [nickhentschel.com](http://nickhentschel.com "Nick Hentschel").
