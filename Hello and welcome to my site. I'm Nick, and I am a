Hello and welcome to my site. I'm Nick, and I am an aspiring web developer and technology enthusiast. I am currently a student at Bentley University in Waltham, MA studying Computer Information Systems. If you would like to contact me for a project or just to chat, hit up the contact page. Otherwise, check out my projects at the projects page or if you are interested in hiring me, take a look at my resume.

I have developed this site using (hopefully) standards-compliant HTML5, so it will look best in an HTML5 compatible browser like the latest version of Mozialla Firefox or Google Chrome.
